## About Me

I am a Marie-Curie **postdoctoral fellow** specialising in **robotics** with a passion for **service robots  and human-centred design**. Currently based at **University of Cambridge**, I work on projects that integrate **multimodel sensing, morphological design of robots and embodied intelligence**, aiming to **develop robots which can serve a wider range of applications**.

---

## Research Interests

- **Embodied agents**: Robot design directly influences embodied agents by shaping their physical interactions, sensory processing, and adaptive behaviors, ultimately impacting their ability to learn from and respond to their environment effectively.
- **Human-centered systems**: To create human-centered robots, designers should integrate sensory capabilities and adaptive mechanisms that prioritize interpreting human cues, understanding environmental context, and responding with behaviors aligned with natural human interaction patterns.
- **Soft Robotics**: Soft robotics enhances these concepts by providing flexible, adaptive structures that better mimic human motion and tactile responsiveness, enabling more intuitive, safe, and effective interactions with people and environments.
- **Bio-inspired robots**: Bio-inspired robots achieve embodiment by replicating natural forms and adaptive behaviors, allowing them to navigate and interact within environments more organically and effectively, similar to living organisms.

## Projects

### Robopatient
Robopatient is a medical robotic simulator which investigates how human participants use haptic exploration behaviours to detect abnormalities in a soft tissue given palpation force constraints. Research around this platform focuses on  training medical students to perform physical examinations on patients under constraints imposed by pain expressions conditioned by different gender and culture backgrounds. Robopatient is currently capable of generating "pain" based on pain expressions such as facial expressions and pain sound based on palpation during diagnosis. I am using this robotic platform to study the embodied generation of pain expressions.

### Soft manipulation
The exceptional dexterity, adaptability, and sensory feedback of human and primate hands serve as a gold standard for developing soft robotic hands, inspiring designs that aim to replicate nuanced movements, grip versatility, and tactile precision for complex tasks.

### Simulation work
I am using multi-agent systems (MAS), information theory and machine learning to simulate context-aware models in complex environments.

### Robot building 
I love building robots! Here are some designs I developed for robots, human studies and exhibitions during the last two years.

## Selecetd Publications

- **Effect of Material Viscosity on Tactile Compliance Discrimination** - *BioRob*, 2024 (Nominated for best paper award)
  Explores how varying viscosity levels in materials influence the ability of tactile sensors to discern compliance, or softness, during physical interaction. It emphasizes the role of material properties in enhancing robotic tactile perception, which is critical for fine-tuned, adaptive handling in tasks requiring sensitivity to texture and pliability.
  
- **Proactive Robots With the Perception of Nonverbal Human Behavior: A Review** - *IEEE ACCESS*, 2019  
  In this work, I explored how robots can interpret nonverbal human cues—such as gestures, facial expressions, and posture—to anticipate needs and act proactively in various interactions. It emphasizes advancements in machine learning and sensor technology that enable robots to achieve more natural, human-centered interactions through nuanced understanding of these behaviors. This is a highlight of my PhD work.  [Link to publication](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8734064/)

- **Enhancing Overall Object Placement by Understanding Uncertain Spatial and Qualitative Distance Information in User Commands** - *ICRA*, 2018  
  This work investigates methods for robots to interpret vague spatial language (e.g., "near," "close to") in user instructions, enabling more accurate object placement. It highlights techniques that allow robots to handle uncertainty in human language, improving their ability to meet user expectations in tasks requiring spatial awareness. [Link to publication](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8460624)

- **Situation Awareness for Proactive Robots in HRI** - *IROS*, 2019
  Examines how robots can develop situation awareness to anticipate human actions and intentions in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). It focuses on enabling robots to assess context dynamically, enhancing proactive assistance and decision-making based on environmental cues and user behaviors.

## News 
- **Fun evening playing chess with college members at Newnham College**: My colleague Liuba Dvinskikh organised a casual chess session with college members. I hadn’t played in about 14 years, so it was refreshing to return to the board—relaxing, engaging, and full of good company.

- **Robots showcase at Cambridge festival**: Cambridge women in robotics organised robots showcase event with the Cambridge festival on the 29th of March. This event was intended for general public, especially kids from age 10 upwards. Had a fun afternoon on 27.02.2025 at BBC Radio Cambridgeshire promoting this event coming up at the Cambridge Festival. I spoke to presenter Louise Holland about our motivations with this event, robot building and women in robotics Cambridge.

- **Talk at CUED BioEngineering Conference 2025**: I had the opportunity to present my work on "Synthetic Generation of Pain Expressions for Robopatients" at the Cambridge University Bioengineering Conference on Friday, 21 March 2025, held at St. Catherine’s College. It was my first time speaking to an audience comprised entirely of biology experts—an exciting shift in perspective. I hope the talk sparked some interesting cross-disciplinary discussions. It's always fascinating to see how robots still evoke more fear than familiarity for some!

- **Teaching in Cambridge**: This marks my third year teaching at the University of Cambridge. So far, I have delivered lectures on Soft Robotics, Human-Robot Interaction, and Machine Learning for Robotic Control. My teaching journey began during my second year as a PhD candidate at the University of Moratuwa. The experience gained, combined with the outcomes of my PhD, led to my appointment as a lecturer in Mechatronics at Sri Lanka Technological Campus, just eight months after my defense in December 2020. Through this journey, I have gained valuable insights into teaching methodologies, from preparing lecture materials to effectively engaging with students across a wide age range, from young undergraduates to professionals nearing retirement.
